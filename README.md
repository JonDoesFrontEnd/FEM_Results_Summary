## My process
I am trying to only do vanilla HTML/CSS to get a good grasp of the basics. I found this project to be a step up in challenge from the other beginner projects, and struggled to keep the solution neat.

However - this time I tried to build mobile-first, which simplified making it responsive. 

### What I learned
I learned the importance of keeping the html/css clean, and how easy it to create a complete mess of your solution. Next challenge I'll make an effort to refactor along the way. 

## Feedback
I'm quite new to this, and I'd love feedback on how I can improve the project. 
Especially I'm interested in HTML/CSS best practices, and how I could've made the code cleaner.
